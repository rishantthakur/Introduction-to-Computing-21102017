# Assignment - 4


# Question 1

# Marking for grades
# a) Below 25 - F
# b) 25 to 45 - E
# c) 45 to 50 - D
# d) 50 to 60 - C
# e) 60 to 80 - B
# f) Above 80 - A

# Input marks by user

# Question - 2

# input year by user to check if leap year

# check if its divisible by 400 or not

# For rest of the cases as they are not leap year
else :

# Question - 3

import random

# Taking turns to set while loop for number of questions
# As each time it runs new ques comes

turns = 0
n = 1
print()
# Asking user for number of questons in the test
ques = int(input("How many questions needed to be there in test :\n"))


# While loop helps us to go again and again and setting ques 
# This can make mny ques without typing them actually
while turns < ques:
    n_1 = random.randint(1,10)
    n_2 = random.randint(1,10)

        print("Your given answer is Correct")
    else :

    # For making finite loop +1 is done
    turns = turns + 1
